# Sales Forecasting

This repository records various approaches to time series analysis to predict sales for 3 months into the future given data of the 
past 5 years of 50 items over 10 stores.

The approaches taken were:

1.XGBoost

2.LSTM

3.Prophet

4.Seasonal ARIMA

Before we start forecasting we first do an exploratory data analysis to figure out trends in the data set. We see that in this dataset sales although on the rise show a pattern. This data is seasonal.
